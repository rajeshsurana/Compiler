{"name":"Compiler-cse340","tagline":"A basic compiler which creates intermediate code from source code","body":"# Welcome to [Rajesh's](http://www.rajeshsurana.com) Compiler wiki!\r\n\r\nThis compiler is a result of course CSE340 project. It is completely error free and robust! Let's start checking it now! This is the compiler for Java like language. It almost covers all the constructs. In the [Parser Requirement](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/Compiler-CSE340/blob/master/assignment%2002.pdf) document you can check out the supported constructs. You first need to make sure that JDK is installed on your machine. Then, download the .jar from [here](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/Compiler-CSE340/blob/master/Compiler.jar) by clicking on the 'view raw'. \r\n\r\nGUI of this compiler is divided into 4 sections-\r\n## 1.Lexer\r\nRequirement and specifications can be found [here.](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/Compiler/blob/master/assignment%2001.pdf) \r\nHere is the snapshot of Lexer-![Lexer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rajeshsurana/Compiler-CSE340/master/Images/Lexer.jpg)\r\n## 2.Parser\r\nRequirement and specifications can be found [here.](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/Compiler/blob/master/assignment%2002.pdf) \r\nSnapshot of Parser-![Parser](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rajeshsurana/Compiler-CSE340/master/Images/Parser.jpg)\r\n## 3.Semantic Analyzer\r\nRequirement and specifications can be found [here.](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/Compiler/blob/master/assignment%2003.pdf)\r\nSnapshot of Semantic Analyzer-![Semantic Analyzer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rajeshsurana/Compiler-CSE340/master/Images/SemanticAnalyzer.jpg)\r\n## 4.Code Generator\r\nRequirement and specifications can be found [here.] (https://github.com/rajeshsurana/Compiler/blob/master/assignment%2004.pdf) To execute the output of the code generator paste the output in the Virtual machine which can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/Compiler-CSE340/blob/master/VM340(6).jar).\r\nSnapshot of Code Generator-![Code Generator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rajeshsurana/Compiler-CSE340/master/Images/CodeGenerator.jpg)\r\n\r\n***\r\nNote:All problem statements are provided by the course instructor (Prof. Gonzalez-Sanchez, Javier).\r\n","google":"UA-64574671-6","note":"Don't delete this file!
